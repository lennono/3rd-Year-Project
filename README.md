# 3rd Year Project
A tutor-student web application to help students find tutors and tutors find students. 

Users of the application can sign up as either a tutor or a student. Each user has a profile which they can edit to display some of their information. Students can view tutors for any given subject and request a meet up. Was planned as a subscription service 

Makes use of javascript to dynamically update pages.

Php is used to interact with the database and the web application.
